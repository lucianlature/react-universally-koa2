# HTTP - Koa

This is a feature repository of [`react-universally`](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally), currently built against `v10.1.1`.

It provides you with a simple Koa2 base implementation.

  Koa is the next generation web framework for node.js, designed by the same people who created Express. 
  It allows writing code without using callbacks by using the `async/await` operators, therefore also greatly increasing the readability and robustness of the application.

  Koa is not bundled with any middleware, but there is a [large collection](https://github.com/koajs/koa/wiki) of community middleware to choose from.

## Koa v2

```js
// Koa application is now a class and requires the new operator.
const app = new Koa();

// uses async arrow functions
app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  try {
    await next(); // next is now a function
  } catch (err) {
    ctx.body = { message: err.message };
    ctx.status = err.status || 500;
  }
});

app.use(async ctx => {
  const user = await User.getById(ctx.session.userid); // await instead of yield
  ctx.body = user; // ctx instead of this
});
```
